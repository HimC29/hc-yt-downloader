## 🤔 Why This Project?

Most YouTube downloaders are either bloated with ads, require browser extensions, or are shady websites that can't be trusted. This project gives you a clean, self-hosted alternative you can run locally in seconds.

- 🚫 **No ads or tracking** — it's just a local web server
- 🛠 **Full control** — open source, you can see exactly what it does
- ⚡ **One paste, one click** — paste URL, choose format, download
- 🧠 **Learning project** — built to learn Flask and yt-dlp

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (required for MP3 extraction and MP4 merging)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HimC29/hc-yt-downloader.git
   cd hc-yt-downloader
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-cors yt-dlp
   ```

3. **Run the server**
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

4. **Open in your browser**  
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

> ⚠️ **Note:** This uses Flask's built-in development server, which is intended for local use only. Do not expose it to the public internet.

---

## 📖 Usage

1. Paste a YouTube URL into the input field  
   *(supports `youtube.com/watch`, `youtu.be`, `music.youtube.com`, `youtube.com/shorts`, and `youtube.com/playlist`)*

2. Toggle between **Video** (MP4) and **Audio** (MP3) using the left button

3. Click **Download**

4. The file will be downloaded directly to your browser's downloads folder — playlists are delivered as a ZIP

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Flow

```
Browser form submit
    └─► POST /mp4 or /mp3 (single video)
    └─► POST /playlist-mp4 or /playlist-mp3 (playlist)
            └─► yt-dlp downloads the file(s) to /downloads
                    └─► Flask streams the file (or ZIP) back to the browser
                            └─► File(s) and folders are deleted from server after sending
```

### Format Handling

- **MP4** — uses `bestvideo+bestaudio/best` and merges with FFmpeg
- **MP3** — uses `bestaudio/best` and extracts audio with FFmpeg's `FFmpegExtractAudio` postprocessor
- **Playlist** — downloads all videos into a subfolder, zips them, and sends the ZIP

### Filename

The original video title is used as the filename, passed back to the browser via the `X-Filename` response header.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### The page doesn't load
- Make sure the server is running with `python server.py`
- Check that you're navigating to `http://localhost:5000` (not `5001` or another port)

### "Please enter a valid YouTube URL"
- Make sure the URL starts with `https://`
- Supported formats: `youtube.com/watch?v=`, `youtu.be/`, `music.youtube.com/watch?v=`, `youtube.com/shorts/`, `youtube.com/playlist?list=`

### Download fails or hangs
- Make sure FFmpeg is installed and available in your system PATH
- Try updating yt-dlp: `pip install -U yt-dlp`
